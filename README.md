## About

These are a few web development projects I've worked on over the past year for Holberton School. I've also included some past projects I did while learning on freeCodeCamp. After listening to a talk during [ThunderPlains 2020](https://2020.thunderplainsconf.com/) I was inspired to make this site using only HTML and CSS.
